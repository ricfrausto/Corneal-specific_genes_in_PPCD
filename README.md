# Corneal-specific_genes_in_PPCD
R code for the statistical analysis of the expression of evCEpC- and evCEnC-specific genes in PPCD

This is code custom built for a specific project (update with link to preprint coming soon). Code will need to be tweaked for purposes other than for those for which it was created.
